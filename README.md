ABOUT THE PROJECT



The scope of the project is to develop an early pre-diagnosis diabetes prediction model which will give the user an estimate of the probability of them having diabetes within reasonable tolerance levels.

The proposed system will also host additional functionality to monitor the insulin levels of the user continuously as the user
passes in the required data.
